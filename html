			<p>Hi, my name is Valentin, I am a first year student at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/%22%3E"> ESSEC Business School</a> . I have made this profile as if it was a resume, I thought i would be interesting and that it could be usefull for the future. I would like to develop it more as I strengthen my coding skills through this course. </p>
			<p>Thanks to my background, I have a complete profile that can adapt to a lot of situations. I am used to working in a team and am able to deal with a wide range of subjects, be they commercial, technological or social. I have studied humanities for a long time (Geopolitics, Philosophy, History, Sociology...) and, currently, economics and business at ESSEC Business School. I have been an expatriate my whole life, therefore i aspire to an internatinal career in the futur.</p>
